# Warehouse-management
This repository contains entire project in C# for the wahehouse management system, more specifically Finished Goods Warehouse Management system or FGWH. Going further the implementation of this project is also done using HTMS, CSS, JavaScript and the webpage is hoasted on the internet, here is the link for the webpage: [FGWH](https://fgwh.my-style.in/)

### Here's what the code does in simpler terms:

1.  connects to a computer "database" that stores all the information about orders and products.<br>
2. There are two lists or tables: one for orders and one for products. The program can show these lists on the screen so that people can see what needs to be done.<br>
3. When new orders come in, the program checks the database and shows the details of these orders on the screen. It tells when the order was made, what products are needed, and how many of each product.<br>
4. When products arrive at the warehouse, the program checks again and shows the details on the screen. It tells where the products are stored in the warehouse.<br>
5. The program can also create something like a "shopping list" called a "pick list" for the workers. This list helps them find the right products quickly.<br>
6. If products need to be moved or sent out, the program helps with that too. It updates the records and shows what stage the products are in (like packaging or shipping).<br>
7. The program also has a message box where it shows messages about what it's doing, like fetching information or completing tasks.<br>

###### The database file is also attached above for the connection with MySql database replace "your_username" and "your_password" with your actual MySQL credentials in the form1.cs file.
